scripts to merge pharmaview and relay pipeline data.

Requirements:

    PV data extract (using the superset, ingested into a mysql table)

    rvi_today extract (or dbi connection). We are only interested in the last n months (18 / 24 ?)

    Mapping files for drugs and companies: RV names need to be mapped to the realy names where possible.

Business logic:

Pharmaview pipeline data takes priority.

Pharmaview does not have as complete early stage data as Relay (< phase 2) so
incorporate the Relay data if not in PV.

For pipeline data with multiple companies:


merge_pv_relay.pl is the main script. per decisions it will write a mysql table which will be pulled into the reconcilation process (Sam details)

TODO:
For subsequent updates, we will need to pull trials from clinicaltrials.gov, using the logic we've developed to
identify events (maybe can just use the events table ??), then filter this data further using the pipleine reconciliation rules

This data wll be tagged and entity extracted on disease /drug /company, USDING the Solr Tagger. there will be no need to do AIE Ingest / entity dump /RVI
